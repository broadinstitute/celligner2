# data explanation

This folder contains what is required to make the datasets. The notebooks represent the different datasets version. However in order to run them you will sometime need to get some specific access but one dataset can be switched with another.

The important thing to remember is outlined in the notebooks. knowning things like the platform, method, group.. will have an impact. you need to use counts and not normalized value like tpms; fpkms etc..

things to note is that CCLF samples are sometimes tumors..

An important part of the data is also regarding the reannotation I made. Here I had to manually reannotate some lines etc using google spreadsheets but all of the logic should be in the notebooks.

From this notebook you can compile some of the largest human bulk RNAseq dataset compendium available. ~30,000 samples.
